  abstract={{MARK} provides parameter estimates from marked animals when they are re-encountered at a later time as dead recoveries, or live recaptures or re-sightings. The time intervals between re-encounters do not have to be equal. More than one attribute group of animals can be modelled. The basic input to {MARK} is the encounter history for each animal. {MARK} can also estimate the size of closed populations. Parameters can be constrained to be the same across re-encounter occasions, or by age, or group, using the parameter index matrix. A set of common models for initial screening of data are provided. Time effects, group effects, time x group effects and a null model of none of the above, are provided for each parameter. Besides the logit function to link the design matrix to the parameters of the model, other link functions include the log—log, complimentary log—log, sine, log, and identity. The estimates of model parameters are computed via numerical maximum likelihood techniques. The number of parameters that are estimable in the model are determined numerically and used to compute the quasi-likelihood {AIC} value for the model. Both the input data, and outputs for various models that the user has built, are stored in the Results database which contains a complete description of the model building process. It is viewed and manipulated in a Results Browser window. Summaries available from this window include viewing and printing model output, deviance residuals from the model, likelihood ratio and analysis of deviance between models, and adjustments for over dispersion. Models can also be retrieved and modified to create additional models. These capabilities are implemented in a Microsoft Windows 95 interface. The online help system has been developed to provide all necessary program documentation.}

  abstract = {The distribution of animals is influenced by numerous factors including spatial distribution and temporal availability of resources. We tested the spatial resource variability hypothesis (increasing landscape heterogeneity results in increasing amount of space use) and the temporal resource variability hypothesis (temporal variation in resources reduces amount of space use) using location data from radiomarked American black bears Ursus americanus in Missouri and Arkansas, {USA.} We used 95\% utilization distributions {(UDs)} to define individual seasonal space use and constructed 22 models using covariates that described composition, spatial arrangement and diversity of land cover types (an index of heterogeneity or patchiness); seasonal hard mast production; and seasonal use of land cover to test our hypotheses using linear modeling and small-sample Akaike information criterion {(AICc)} model selection approaches. The {AICc} best performing model supported the spatial resource variability hypothesis and included Shannon diversity index [95\% confidence limit {(CL)} of coefficient = 1.56–2.42] and sex (male; 95\% {CL} of coefficient = 0.05–0.49) as covariates that explained variation in transformed values of {UD} size. Predicted and observed values during model evaluation were highly correlated (r = 0.90). As land cover heterogeneity increased, {UD} size increased, likely a consequence of bears responding to greater patchiness to maintain sufficient resources. Further, the Shannon diversity index was greater for males than females , suggesting larger bodied males used larger areas to meet their higher energetic costs due to landscape fragmentation. Studies of resource hypotheses in solitary species should consider intraspecific allometric relationships such as sexual size dimorphism as has been addressed using group size in social species.},

  abstract = {The trade-off between predator avoidance and foraging is a key decision making factor that shapes an organism's adaptive behaviour and movement patterns. Human hunters act as top predators to influence the behaviour of free-ranging mammals, including large carnivorous species such as black bears {(Ursus} americanus). Analysing the effects of hunting on animal behavioural patterns is essential for understanding the extent to which animals detect and respond to human-induced disturbances. To this end, we assessed whether black bear movement behaviour changed with varying risk from spatially and temporally heterogeneous human predation. Levels of risk were categorized as either low (disturbance from dog training; n=19 bears) or high (disturbance from hunting activities; n=11 bears). Road types were either paved (risk due to vehicles) or non-paved (risk due to hunters) and were used as proxies for hunting effort and amount of disturbance. We began by testing the null hypothesis that bears’ distribution before the onset of human disturbance is spatially random. Next, to test temporal movement adjustment between the low and high risk levels, we measured the distance to the nearest road and the road crossing frequency using mixed effects models with risk level, time of day and sex as predictor {variables.As} disturbance near non-paved roads increased due to the start of the hunting activity, the mean distances of bears to non-paved roads increased while the mean distances of bears to paved roads decreased, despite the continual risk of vehicle collision. These behavioural responses were observed during day and night, with the frequency of crossing paved roads at night five times greater than in daytime during the hunting {season.Our} findings demonstrate that black bears are able to detect risky places and adjust their spatial movements accordingly. More specifically, bears can perceive changes in the level of risk from human hunting activities on a fine temporal scale.},

  pages    = {e34575},
  abstract = {When estimating population density from data collected on non-invasive detector arrays, recently developed spatial capture-recapture {(SCR)} models present an advance over non-spatial models by accounting for individual movement. While these models should be more robust to changes in trapping designs, they have not been well tested. Here we investigate how the spatial arrangement and size of the trapping array influence parameter estimates for {SCR} models. We analysed black bear data collected with 123 hair snares with an {SCR} model accounting for differences in detection and movement between sexes and across the trapping occasions. To see how the size of the trap array and trap dispersion influence parameter estimates, we repeated analysis for data from subsets of traps: 50\% chosen at random, 50\% in the centre of the array and 20\% in the South of the array. Additionally, we simulated and analysed data under a suite of trap designs and home range sizes. In the black bear study, we found that results were similar across trap arrays, except when only 20\% of the array was used. Black bear density was approximately 10 individuals per 100 km(2). Our simulation study showed that {SCR} models performed well as long as the extent of the trap array was similar to or larger than the extent of individual movement during the study period, and movement was at least half the distance between traps. {SCR} models performed well across a range of spatial trap setups and animal movements. Contrary to non-spatial capture-recapture models, they do not require the trapping grid to cover an area several times the average home range of the studied species. This renders {SCR} models more appropriate for the study of wide-ranging mammals and more flexible to design studies targeting multiple species.},

  abstract = {In recent years, much progress has been made in non-invasive genetic methods for various purposes including population estimation. Previous research focused on optimising laboratory protocols and assessing genotyping errors. However, an important source of bias in population estimates still remains in the field sampling methods. The probability of animals being sampled can vary according to sex, age, social status or home-range location. In this article, we present relevant literature reviewed to provide an overview of the occurrence of individual heterogeneity {(IH)} in the field, and how it can be minimised, e.g. by adaptation of sampling design. We surveyed 38 articles describing non-invasive population estimation for 12 mammal and two bird species. The majority of these studies discussed {IH} as a potential problem. The detectability of {IH} via goodness-of-fit testing depended on the average capture probability reported in the studies. Field tests for assessing variation in sampling probabilities or validating estimations were carried out in only 11 of the 38 studies. The results of these tests point out that {IH} is a widespread problem in non-invasive population estimation, which deserves closer attention not only in the development of laboratory protocols but also concerning the sampled species' characteristics and the field methods. {IH} can be reduced in the field by carefully adapting the sampling design to the characteristics of the studied population. If this is not reasonable, it may be better to switch to a different sampling strategy.},

However, bias due to a behavioural response to capture in the presence of missing data has only recently been recognized and no statistical methodology exists to accommodate it. In a hair snare mark-recapture experiment, data can be missing if animals encounter a hair snare without leaving a hair sample, poor-quality samples are not genotyped, a fraction of all samples collected are genotyped due to cost considerations (subsampling) and/or not all genotyped hair samples provide an individual identification. These are all common features of hair snare mark-recapture {experiments.Here,} we present methodology that accounts for a behavioural response to capture in the presence of missing data from (i) subsampling and (ii) failure of hair samples to produce an individual identification. Four subprocesses are modelled–animal capture, hair deposition, researcher subsampling and {DNA} amplification with key parameters estimated from functions of the number of hair samples left by individuals at traps. We assess the properties of this methodology (bias and interval coverage) via simulation and then apply this methodology to a previously published data {set.Our} methodology removes bias and provides nominal interval coverage of population size for the simulation scenarios considered. In the example data set, we find that removing 75\% of the hair samples leads to a 40\% lower estimate of population size. Our methodology corrects about half of this bias and we identify a second source of bias that has not previously been reported associated with differential trap visitation rates among individuals within trapping {occasions.Our} methodology will allow researchers to reliably estimate the size of a closed population in the presence of a behavioural response to capture and missing data for a subset of missing data scenarios. It also provides a framework for understanding this generally unrecognized problem and for further extension to handle other missing data scenarios.},
